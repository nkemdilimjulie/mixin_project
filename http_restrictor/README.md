To implement the RestrictMethodsMixin in your Django project, you can define it in the mixins.py file within your http_restrictor app. This mixin will restrict access to specific HTTP methods for class-based views. Here's how you can implement it:

Define the Mixin in mixins.py: see mixins.py 

## Explanation:  http_restrictor/mixins.py
The allowed_methods attribute specifies which HTTP methods are permitted. By default, it's set to ['GET'].
The dispatch method checks if the incoming request's method is in the allowed_methods list. If not, it returns an HttpResponseNotAllowed response, indicating that the method is not permitted. Otherwise, it proceeds with the standard dispatch process by calling super().dispatch().

Next, use the Mixin in a View: see views.py

## Explanation: http_restrictor/views.py

By inheriting from RestrictMethodsMixin, MyRestrictedView gains the method restriction functionality.
The allowed_methods attribute is overridden to permit both GET and POST requests for this specific view.
The get and post methods define how to handle GET and POST requests, respectively.

Next, configure URLs: see urls.py in app http_restrictor.py

## Explanation: http_restrictor/urls.py 
This URL configuration maps the 'restricted/' URL pattern to the MyRestrictedView class-based view.


Next, Include the app's URLs in the project's main urls.py file:

(see the code in the projects urls.py - django_project/urls.py)

Lastly:

Run the Development Server and Test:
   - Start the server:

     python manage.py runserver
     

- Test the endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8000/restricted/:
     - GET Request: Should return "This is a GET request."
    - *POST Request*: Should return "This is a POST request."
     - PUT or DELETE Request: Should return "405 Method Not Allowed."
To make Post, Put or DELETE request you can use curl
 curl -X POST  https://example.com/endpoint (edited) 



## Additional or other Considerations:

#### Customizing Allowed Methods:

You can customize the allowed_methods attribute for each view that inherits from RestrictMethodsMixin to specify which HTTP methods should be permitted.
Error Handling:

The HttpResponseNotAllowed response automatically includes the Allow header, listing the permitted methods, which helps clients understand which methods are acceptable.
Integration with Other Mixins:

**Ensure that RestrictMethodsMixin is placed before View in the inheritance list to properly override the dispatch method.**
By following this implementation, you can effectively control which HTTP methods are allowed for your class-based views in Django, enhancing the security and robustness of your application.
